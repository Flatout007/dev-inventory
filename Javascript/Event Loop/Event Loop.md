(Event loop)

- Event Loop is critical for understanding asynchronous javascript.


- JavaScript event loop system consit of a call stack, APIs, Console, and the event queue or "message queue" all working in tandem 


(Execution Stack)
- the Execution Stack or "call stack" manages function and method calls in a stack like structure.


(APIs)
- the api's or "web api's" interface has to be fetched from an external source during run time.


(Console)
- the console prints data such as strings or numbers


(Event Queue)
- the event queue or message queue stores method calls from the "web api" in a queue like structure.


(Event Loop System)
- the event loop is designed to execute calls until the call stack is empty,
 queue whatever event is in the event queue, and fire it from the call stack.
