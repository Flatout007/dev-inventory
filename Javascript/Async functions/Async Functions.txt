(Async Functions)

- Async Functions are used to consume and manage promise objects.

- In JavaScript "async" is a keyword, its normally used in tandem with the "await" keyword.


(Declare async functions)
- insert "async" keyword before a function decleration. 
Syntax: async function name() {}


(Consume promise objects)
- call a promise with the "await" keyword in front of the function or method call. 
Syntax: await f(n)


(Call async functions)
- calling an async function is the same as any function. 
Syntax: f()


(Return values from async functions)
- use "then() & catch" to return values from async functions. 
Syntax: async function {return data}.then(callback(data){}).catch(e)
