(Booleans)

- booleans determine true or false based on conditions or when using "true false" keywords.

- in PHP as well as other programming languages, booleans have operators to control flow.


(Operators)
- in PHP the "|| &amp;&amp;" operators are spelled out in english.
 Ex: var_dump ($is_to_be or $is_not_to_be) var_dump($is_to_be and $is_not_to_be)


(Comparison operators with if statements)
- use comparison operators to compare data and control flow with if statements
syntax: if(100 &lt; 2000) {echo 100}
